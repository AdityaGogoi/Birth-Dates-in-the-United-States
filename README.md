The raw data behind the story Some People Are Too Superstitious To Have A Baby On Friday The 13th, which you can read here(http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-people-are-too-superstitious-to-have-a-baby-on-friday-the-13th/).

In this project we will be working with the data set from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.
The data set has the following structure:

1. year - Year
2. month - Month
3. date_of_month - Day number of the month
4. day_of_week - Day of week, where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday
5. births - Number of births

We will explore the births that occured in the US based on the year, month and also the day of the week in this project.
